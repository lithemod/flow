use Lithe\Http\Response;

function my_middleware($options) {
    return function (\Lithe\Http\Request $req, \Lithe\Http\Response $res, closure $next) use ($options) {
        // Middleware implementation based on the options array

        // Example: Modify the response
        $res->setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'Value');
        
        // Call the next middleware
        $next();
    };
};
